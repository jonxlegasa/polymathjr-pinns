# PINN_specific.jl

Specialized solver for first-order ODEs of the form `ay' + by = 0`.

**Location:** `modelcode/PINN_specific.jl`

---

## Overview

Optimized implementation for a specific class of first-order linear ODEs.

---

## PINNSettings Struct

```julia
struct PINNSettings
    Layers::Int      # Number of layers
    Dimension::Int   # Hidden dimension
    Output::Int      # Output size
end
```

---

## Use Case

When working exclusively with `ay' + by = 0` type equations, this specialized solver may offer:
- Faster training
- Better convergence
- Simplified configuration
